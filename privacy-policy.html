  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Extension:</strong> ChatBots Two Columns UI Fix</p>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-05</p>
  <p class="muted">This policy explains what information the extension can access and how it is handled.</p>

  <h2>What the extension does</h2>
  <p>
    This extension adjusts the layout of supported chatbot websites on large screens by injecting CSS and a small amount
    of page logic (for example: applying a two-column conversation layout, adding spacing controls, and optionally hiding
    or collapsing certain UI sections such as “Related” panels).
  </p>

  <h2>Where it runs</h2>
  <p>
    The extension runs only on the specific websites listed in its <code>matches</code> configuration
    (for example: chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com, perplexity.ai, grok.com / x.com grok pages,
    and other listed chatbot domains). It does not run on arbitrary websites.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requests the <code>storage</code> permission to save your layout preferences.
    It does not request broad host permissions beyond the supported site list.
  </p>

  <h2>Information the extension may access</h2>
  <p>
    To apply layout changes, the extension may read and modify webpage elements on supported sites (the page DOM),
    for example to classify chat messages for layout or to attach UI toggles. This processing occurs locally in your browser.
  </p>

  <h2>Data collection</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, sell, or transfer personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data transmission</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> send data to the developer or to third parties.
    It does not include analytics, advertising, tracking, telemetry, or remote logging, and it does not make network
    requests for data collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Data storage</h2>
  <p>
    The extension stores only user preferences required for functionality (such as enabling/disabling the side-by-side
    layout and the selected column ratios / spacing). These preferences are saved using Chrome’s extension storage
    (for example <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>), so they may sync across your Chrome browsers if you have sync enabled.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension does not store your chat content, browsing history, or full page content.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    The extension does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this same URL with a new effective date.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
