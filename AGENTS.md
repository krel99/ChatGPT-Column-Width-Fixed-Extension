Purpose of this extension is to take advantage of the space on most monitors.

The default settings of AI chatbots allows a single column in the middle with ample white space to each side.

The goal is to make either a) an option to have a single column taking all space or b) two columns one with prompt and one with response.

Input box should be in either case unimpacted.
